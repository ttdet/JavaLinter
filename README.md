# JavaLinter
A course project. It's a Java Linter. I implemented TrainWreck (violation of least knowledge principle) detector, Abstract Factory pattern detector, and Redundant Constructor detector, as well as some features in presentation layer and the majority of data source layer. 
The original code also contain JUnit test cases. They are not included here.

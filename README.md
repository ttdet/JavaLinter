# JavaLinter
A course project. It's a Java Linter capable of parsing Java bytecode using ASM and detecting design principle violations and design patterns. It also performs cursory style checks. I implemented TrainWreck (violation of least knowledge principle) detector, Abstract Factory pattern detector, and Redundant Constructor detector, as well as some features in presentation layer and the majority of data source layer. 
The original code also contain JUnit test cases. They are not included here.
